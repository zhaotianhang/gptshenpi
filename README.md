This repository provides core data models for an approval workflow system.
Models are defined using [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) in the
`models` directory. These models cover users, organizations, departments,
approval templates, forms, records and notifications to support approval
processing, delegation and push notifications.
